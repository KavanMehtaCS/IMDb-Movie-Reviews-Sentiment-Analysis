        "*   This project uses 25,000 IMDb movie reviews for training and uses a recurrent neural network. A recurrent neural network is a network that “feedbacks” its input and output data to almost “memorize” the correct outputs. It functions like a usual neural network where it learns from its past errors but it takes into account the output of the previous neuron as context for its next neuron which is enabled by using an internal memory.\n",
        "*   It uses word embeddings where words are kept closer in vector space dependent on their meanings. It uses these vectors to hold information about previous words in the text sequence and applies a non-linear activation function to find the final summation. It then calculates the predicted sentiment (positive or negative) through a sigmoid function which calculates probabilities of 0 and 1. At the end, it uses a cross-entropy loss function to find out the loss among the predicted and actual values to backtrack and improve the model.\n",

        "The Image classification and most other neural networks are called **feed-forward** neural networks. This simply means that all our data is fed forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word which is how a recurrent neural network functions. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop. A RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire input, one word at a time.\n",

Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear.\n",
